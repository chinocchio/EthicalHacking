# Ethical Hacking Technical Report

## Sample Name of Company: Acme Inc.

### Executive Summary:

This report details the findings of an ethical hacking assessment conducted for Acme Inc. The assessment, authorized in writing on 10/05/2024, aimed to identify vulnerabilities within the organization's network infrastructure, applications, and systems. Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning methodologies were employed to uncover critical, high, and medium-risk security weaknesses. This report outlines these vulnerabilities, assigns a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score for each, and provides actionable recommendations for remediation.

### Vulnerability Summary:

- **SQL Injection** (CVE-2023-4567, CVSS: 9.8): The company website login form is susceptible to SQL injection attacks, potentially allowing attackers to steal user credentials or manipulate data.
- **Unrestricted File Upload** (CVE-2014-10047, CVSS: 8.8): The internal file upload functionality lacks proper validation, enabling attackers to upload malicious scripts and gain unauthorized access.
- **Weak Password Policies** (CVSS: 5.3): Password complexity requirements are insufficient, making user accounts vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Missing Security Patches** (Various CVEs, CVSS: Variable): Several critical and high-risk security patches are missing from various network devices and software applications.
- **Open Ports** (CVSS: Variable): Unnecessary network ports are exposed to the internet, increasing the attack surface.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (CVE-2024-1234, CVSS: 7.5): The company forum is vulnerable to XSS attacks, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts and steal user sessions or sensitive information.
- **Insecure Password Storage** (CVSS: 6.5): User passwords are stored using a weak hashing algorithm, making them vulnerable to decryption in a data breach.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Vulnerability** (CVE-2022-7890, CVSS: 7.2): The application server is susceptible to DoS attacks, potentially leading to website outages and service disruptions.
- **Misconfigured Firewall Rules** (CVSS: 5.0): Inappropriate firewall rules allow unauthorized traffic, bypassing security controls.
- **Insecure Wireless Network** (CVSS: 4.0): The company's Wi-Fi network lacks strong encryption, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive data.
- **Unattended Physical Access** (CVSS: N/A): Unlocked server rooms and unattended workstations pose a physical security risk.
- **Social Engineering Susceptibility** (CVSS: N/A): Employees lack awareness of common social engineering tactics, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware infections.
- **Outdated Software** (Various CVEs, CVSS: Variable): Several applications and operating systems are outdated and no longer supported, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits.
- **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring** (CVSS: 3.0): Inadequate logging and monitoring practices make it difficult to detect suspicious activity.
- **Lack of Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan** (CVSS: N/A): The absence of a formal backup and disaster recovery plan hinders the organization's ability to recover from data loss or system outages.

### Recommendations for Remediation:

1. Implement secure coding practices and input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Enforce strict file upload restrictions, including size and type limitations.
3. Establish strong password policies with minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes.
4. Update all systems and devices with the latest security patches promptly.
5. Conduct a thorough port scan and close any unnecessary ports on network devices.
6. Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.
7. Store passwords using a strong hashing algorithm with a salt.
8. Implement security measures to mitigate DoS attacks.
9. Review and adjust firewall rules to enforce appropriate network access control.
10. Secure the Wi-Fi network with strong WPA2 encryption and change the default password.
11. Implement physical security measures, including access control systems and locked server rooms.
12. Conduct security awareness training for employees to educate them on social engineering tactics.
13. Update all software applications and operating systems to the latest versions.
14. Implement a comprehensive logging and monitoring strategy to track system activity and identify potential threats.
15. Develop a formal backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of IT disruptions.

### Conclusion:

This ethical hacking assessment identified several vulnerabilities across Acme Inc.'s network infrastructure, applications, and systems. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended remediation measures will significantly enhance the organization's overall security posture and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches.
